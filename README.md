# Budget-Tracker

# Description

This project creates an application used to track an individual's budget while traveling. The user is able to track withdrawals and deposits they make, whether they have a connection to the internet or not. 

This application utilizes a MongoDB database as well as IndexedDB, which is used to cache transactions while the application is offline.

The app is deployed through Heroku. **[Check out the site here!](https://budget-tracker-wy.herokuapp.com/)**
